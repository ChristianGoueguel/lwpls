# Diagnostic plots for spectroscopy

LW-PLS builds one local model per new sample, so the usual score and
loading plots of a global PLS model have no direct equivalent. The
diagnostics of lwpls answer the questions that matter when a calibration
is used, for example on near-infrared spectra:

1.  **Can I trust this prediction?** Is the new spectrum within the
    applicability domain of its local model?
2.  **Which bands drive the predictions**, and how do they change across
    the range of the outcome?
3.  **Which reference values are suspect** (robust models)?
4.  **Which wavelengths are selected** (sparse models)?

[`lwpls_local()`](https://christiangoueguel.com/lwpls/reference/lwpls_local.md)
returns the local models of a set of new samples with these diagnostics,
and four plot functions draw them.

``` r

library(lwpls)
library(rsample)

data(meats, package = "modeldata")
meats <- meats[, !names(meats) %in% c("fat", "protein")]

set.seed(123)
meats_split <- initial_split(meats, prop = 0.75)
meats_train <- training(meats_split)
meats_test <- testing(meats_split)
```

The `meats` data were recorded on a Tecator Infratec Food and Feed
Analyzer: 100 channels of near-infrared absorbance between 850 and 1050
nm. The predictor names (`x_001`, …, `x_100`) only number the channels,
so we give the wavelengths explicitly; they become the x axis of the
plots.

``` r

wavelengths <- seq(850, 1050, length.out = 100)

fit <- lwpls_fit(water ~ ., data = meats_train, num_comp = 10, localization = 0.5)
```

## Can I trust this prediction?

To show what an unusual spectrum looks like, we add three test spectra
with an artificial sloping baseline, as could be caused by a drifting
instrument or a different sample presentation:

``` r

drifted <- meats_test[1:3, ]
drifted[, 1:100] <- drifted[, 1:100] + 0.05 * seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)
new_spectra <- rbind(meats_test, drifted)

local <- lwpls_local(fit, new_spectra, wavelength = wavelengths)
local
#> LW-PLS local models
#> 
#> Queries:           57 
#> Components:        10 
#> Reliability:       49 inside, 3 high Q, 4 high T2 and Q, 1 few neighbors (empirical limits, 95%)
```

For each new spectrum, the reliability table gives the effective number
of training spectra in its local model (`n_eff`), and its Hotelling
\\T^2\\ and \\Q\\ statistics in that model. A large \\T^2\\ means that
the spectrum is extreme within the variation that the local model
describes; a large \\Q\\ means that it contains variation that the local
model does not describe at all. By default, they are compared with
**empirical limits**: the 95% quantiles of the same statistics for the
training spectra of the local model, which make no distributional
assumption.

``` r

plot_reliability(local, log = TRUE)
```

![T2 versus Q of the new spectra, divided by their 95% limits. The three
drifted spectra are far beyond both limits; a few test spectra are just
beyond the Q
limit.](diagnostics_files/figure-html/reliability-plot-1.png)

The three drifted spectra (rows 55 to 57) are far beyond both limits,
with \\Q\\ more than a hundred times its limit, and their predictions
are much less accurate than those of the spectra within the limits (the
`"high T2 and Q"` group below):

``` r

rel <- local$reliability
rel$abs_error <- abs(rel$.pred - new_spectra$water)
aggregate(abs_error ~ status, data = rel, FUN = mean)
#>          status abs_error
#> 1        inside 0.9908363
#> 2        high Q 1.0967050
#> 3 high T2 and Q 6.7109663
#> 4 few neighbors 0.2681041
```

Spectra just beyond one limit, here those with a moderately high \\Q\\,
are predicted about as well as the others: a flag is a warning that
calls for a check, not proof of a bad prediction. In routine use, the
flagged spectra are the ones to check before reporting their
predictions.

### Theoretical limits and percentile ranks

[`lwpls_local()`](https://christiangoueguel.com/lwpls/reference/lwpls_local.md)
also computes the classical **theoretical limits** (an \\F\\ limit for
\\T^2\\ and the Box approximation for \\Q\\, which assume normally
distributed scores and residuals) and the **percentile rank** of each
new spectrum among the training spectra of its local model. The two
kinds of limits agree on most spectra:

``` r

theoretical <- lwpls_local(
  fit,
  new_spectra,
  wavelength = wavelengths,
  limits = "theoretical"
)
table(
  empirical = local$reliability$status,
  theoretical = theoretical$reliability$status
)
#>                theoretical
#> empirical       inside high T2 high Q high T2 and Q few neighbors
#>   inside            48       0      1             0             0
#>   high T2            0       0      0             0             0
#>   high Q             2       0      1             0             0
#>   high T2 and Q      0       0      0             4             0
#>   few neighbors      0       0      0             0             1
```

The empirical limits are computed from the training spectra, which were
used to fit the local models, so they are slightly conservative and can
flag a few more spectra. The percentile ranks show the same comparison
on a continuous scale, from 0% (the least extreme spectrum of the local
model) to 100% (beyond all of them):

``` r

plot_reliability(local, reference = "percentile")
#> Warning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range
#> (`geom_point()`).
#> Warning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range
#> (`geom_text()`).
```

spectra of their local models, with dashed lines at 95%. The drifted
spectra are at 100% on both
axes.](diagnostics_files/figure-html/percentile-plot-1.png)

## Which bands drive the predictions?

Each local model has its own regression vector. Plotted along the
spectrum, one line per new sample colored by its prediction, they show
the bands that the local models use and how they change from lean to fat
meat:

``` r

plot_coefficients(local)
```

![Regression coefficients of the local models along the wavelengths, one
line per new sample colored by its predicted water
content.](diagnostics_files/figure-html/coefficients-1.png)

The heatmap shows the same regression vectors with the new samples
ordered by their prediction, which makes the changes across the range of
water content easier to follow:

``` r

plot_coefficients(local, style = "heatmap")
```

![Heatmap of the local regression coefficients, wavelengths on the x
axis and new samples ordered by predicted water content on the y
axis.](diagnostics_files/figure-html/coefficients-heatmap-1.png)

The variable importance in projection (VIP) of the local models is shown
with `type = "vip"`.

## Which reference values are suspect?

Robust local models (`robust = TRUE`) give small weights to the training
samples that do not fit their neighbors. Averaged over the local models
in which they take part, these weights point to wrong reference values.
Here, we replace 20% of the training water contents by wrong values:

``` r

set.seed(1)
bad <- sample(nrow(meats_train), round(0.2 * nrow(meats_train)))
contaminated <- meats_train
contaminated$water[bad] <- contaminated$water[bad] +
  sample(c(-1, 1), length(bad), replace = TRUE) * runif(length(bad), 15, 30)

robust_fit <- lwpls_fit(
  water ~ .,
  data = contaminated,
  num_comp = 6,
  localization = 2,
  robust = TRUE
)
robust_local <- lwpls_local(robust_fit, meats_test, wavelength = wavelengths)
```

``` r

plot_robust_weights(robust_local, labels = 8)
```

![Average robust weight of each training sample versus its reference
water content. A group of samples has weights close to zero; the lowest
are labeled.](diagnostics_files/figure-html/robust-weights-1.png)

The point size shows the influence of each training sample, the sum of
its similarity weights over the new samples. Here, the samples with the
lowest weights are exactly the ones whose reference values were changed:

``` r

lowest <- order(robust_local$training$robust_weight)[seq_along(bad)]
sum(lowest %in% bad) / length(bad)
#> [1] 1
```

## Which wavelengths are selected?

Sparse local models (`sparsity > 0`) select wavelengths by component. On
smooth near-infrared spectra, successive components select different
bands, so that the model as a whole uses most of the wavelengths; the
selection of each component is then the informative view:

``` r

sparse_fit <- lwpls_fit(
  water ~ .,
  data = meats_train,
  num_comp = 10,
  localization = 0.5,
  sparsity = 0.4
)
sparse_local <- lwpls_local(sparse_fit, meats_test, wavelength = wavelengths)
plot_selection(sparse_local)
```

![Heatmap of how often each wavelength is selected by each component of
the sparse local models.](diagnostics_files/figure-html/selection-1.png)

`plot_selection(by = "model")` shows instead the fraction of local
models that use each wavelength in any component, with the mean spectrum
for reference.

## Customizing the plots

All the plots are ggplot2 objects, so they can be modified with the
usual ggplot2 functions and saved at the size and resolution required by
a journal:

``` r

plot_coefficients(local, axis_label = "Wavelength (nm)") +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "Local regression vectors, water content")
```

![The local regression coefficients with a custom title and axis
label.](diagnostics_files/figure-html/customize-1.png)

``` r

ggplot2::ggsave("coefficients.pdf", width = 17, height = 10, units = "cm")
```

The plots are also available through
[`ggplot2::autoplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/autoplot.html),
for example `autoplot(local, type = "coefficients")`. For wavenumber
axes, which are usually drawn in decreasing order, use `reverse = TRUE`.
